<h2>Assignment 1: Review and Experience Questionnaire</h2>

1. Do you have an previous experience with coding? Which classes have you already taken that explored HTML/CSS or Javascript?
<br/>
<br/>
I got an experience with coding in my Core1 Interaction class last semester. I learnt HTML, CSS and a little bit Javascript in that class.
<br/>
<br/>
2. If you have worked with code in the past, what parts of it made sense to you? Which parts were exciting?
<br/>
<br/>
 HTML is the easiest part for me. It's interesting to learn javascript but it's the hardest and challenging part. The information should be coherent in order to function well.
<br/>
<br/>

3. If you have worked with code in the past, which parts were the most confusing? What were the least interesting?
<br/>
<br/>
The most confusing part is javascript for sure. Little mistake will disturb the whole process. I don't have any least interesting part in coding as each parts are highly related to each other.
<br/>
<br/>

4. Do you have any anxieties around coding, or learning to code? Is there anything I can do to help alleviate those anxieties in this class?
<br/>
<br/>
I felt anxious when the function is not working but I couldn't figure out the problem. I will really appreciate your help under this kind of situation!
<br/>
<br/>

Internet provides platform for communication and interaction. It acts as an archive that provides information briefly by searching key words.
<br/>
<br/>
6. What is the difference between a webpage, a website, and a web server?
<br/>
<br/>
A webpage is one of the pages in a website. A web server is a software that responses to request via HTTP.

MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat.

Numerous games are listed at various web portals, such as The Mud Connector." </div>
